# Polygonal-random-field-sampler
A sampling algorithm for polygonal random fields and markov random fields. Utilised both of these for an image reconstruction problem. Use Dynamic representation v2 instead of Dynamic representation, as the former contains a less efficient implementation which isn't fully functional.

libraries used:
Armadillo (to sample from 2d normal) https://github.com/EmanueleCannizzaro/armadillo
matplot++ (to draw tessellations) https://github.com/alandefreitas/matplotplusplus
opencv (to read and write images) https://github.com/opencv/opencv
