# Polygonal-random-field-sampler
A sampling algorithm for polygonal random fields and markov random fields. Utilised both of these for an image reconstruction problem

libraries used:
Armadillo (to sample from 2d normal) https://github.com/EmanueleCannizzaro/armadillo
matplot++ (to draw tessellations) https://github.com/alandefreitas/matplotplusplus
opencv (to read and write images) https://github.com/opencv/opencv
